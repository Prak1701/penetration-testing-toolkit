**Penetration testing is essential in cybersecurity to identify vulnerabilities in networks and systems before attackers exploit them. This task involved developing a **Penetration Testing Toolkit** using **Python 3**, designed to perform **port scanning, brute-force login testing, and network scanning**. The toolkit was built using the **`socket`** module for detecting open ports, **`requests`** for testing weak credentials, and **`scapy`** for discovering active devices on a network. Since **Scapy requires raw packet capture**, **Npcap** was installed on Windows to enable full network scanning. The entire project was developed in **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**, providing a structured environment for scripting, testing, and debugging. 
This toolkit is highly applicable in **security assessments, penetration testing, and network auditing**, helping identify exposed services, weak authentication systems, and unauthorized devices. It is useful for **ethical hacking training**, where professionals learn how attackers perform reconnaissance and how to implement **firewalls, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and network monitoring tools** for defense. The task provided practical experience in **cybersecurity testing and automation**, reinforcing critical security concepts for real-world applications.**
